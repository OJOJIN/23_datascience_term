The risk of traffic accident deaths in Korea is decreasing year by year.

However, Korea still has a high risk, ranking 27th in the number of traffic accident deaths compared to the population among 36 OECD countries.

Therefore, our team aimed to reduce the risk of traffic accidents by creating a model that predicts the risk of traffic accidents in certain areas of Seoul to help people go out at safer times and to strengthen crackdowns and guide them to be alert during high-risk times
